\epigraph{If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were
to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations
of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the
fewest words? I believe it is the \textit{atomic hypothesis} [...]
that \textit{all things are made of atomsâ€”little particles that move
around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little
distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.}
In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of
information about the world, if just a little imagination and
thinking are applied.}{Richard P. Feynman,\\\textit{The Feynman Lectures on Physics}\\Vol. I}
